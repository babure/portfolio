        About Me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        I'm a professional software engineer with 2 years of experience
        specializing in React.js, Spring Boot, SQL, and MongoDB. I thrive on
        creating efficient and user-friendly web applications that solve
        real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new
        technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good
        cup of coffee while solving coding challenges.
